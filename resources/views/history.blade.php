                            Here are some highlights of our journey so far.
                            
                            <h2 class"">1st December 2011</h2>
                            
                            Vivo Energy was established with Cape Verde, Senegal, Madagascar, Mali, 
                            Mauritius, Morocco, and Tunisia the first countries to join.
                            
                            <h3>2012</h3>
                            
                            We expanded the group with Burkina, Cote D’Ivoire and Guinea (March), 
                            Botswana and Namibia (October) and Kenya (November) joining.
                            
                            <h3>2013</h3>
                            
                            We completed the current group with Uganda (February) and Ghana (August) 
                            taking us up to 15 markets across Africa.
                            We began our Retail network expansion programme, adding over 100 service stations in the year.
                            
                            <h3>2014</h3>
                            
                            We launched our initiative to re-design and expand our convenience 
                            retail and food offer across our network to ensure our sites meet our 
                            customer needs and offer much more than just fuel.
                            
                           <h3>2015</h3> 
                            
                            We invested further in our retail network, signing partnerships with
                             international partners such as Burger King and KFC and add innovative
                              new offers for our customers such as our first loyalty programme in
                               Mauritius.
                            
                            <h3>2016</h3>
                            
                            We completed our 15th differentiated fuel launch in 3 years 
                            (bringing V-Power to Morocco and Tunisia) and signed a new agreement 
                            with Shell to secure the brand for a further 15 years.
                            
                            <h3>2017</h3>
                            
                            We acquired a stake in Shell & Vivo Lubricants (SVL), so that it is
                             jointly owned by Vivo Energy (50%) and Shell (50%). SVL is the company 
                             that sources, blends and manufactures Shell Lubricants in Africa.
                        
                            We entered into a transaction with Engen Holdings to add a number of 
                            new markets to Vivo Energy’s network subject to regulatory approvals.

                            We completed an initial public offering (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange 
                            with a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. This was the 
                            largest African IPO on the London Stock Exchange in over a decade.
                            
                            
                            We restructured the transaction with Engen Holdings in order to add
                             operations in eight new countries and over 225 Engen-branded service
                              stations to Vivo Energy's network from 1st March 2019.
