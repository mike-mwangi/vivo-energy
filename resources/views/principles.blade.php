                            and are the foundation of our business. We uphold these values in everything we do. Indeed, they are crucial to
                            our success and growth as a company, and to achieving
                             our vision of becoming ‘Africa’s most respected energy business
                            These core values are encapsulated in our Code of Conduct and General Business Principles,
                            which outline clear, concrete and detailed principles and ethical actions by which we should
                             conduct ourselves, and drive the behaviour expected of every employee in every Vivo Energy operation at all times.<br><br>

                            The Vivo Energy Health, Safety, Security, Environment, Quality and Social Performance policy and commitment
                            applies across our Group and we require our contractors to manage HSSEQ & SP in accordance with our policy.
                             It is designed to help protect people, the environment and the communities in which we operate. We have Group-wide
                             standards across 12 key risk areas in place to help manage potential impacts and a clear Governance structure
                             through which we control our HSSEQ & SP Management System.
                            We’re committed to reducing our environmental impact and continually improving our environmental performance,
                             and encourage our partners, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders to do the same. In 2019 we updated our

                            Policy to focus on minimising our impact on the environment, in recognition of the Paris Agreement.
