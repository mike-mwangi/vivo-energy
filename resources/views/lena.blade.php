                                <p>Lena Munuve <br> Retail Manager, Vivo Energy <br> Kenya </p>
                                <p>Driven, dynamic, hands on, and with a deep affinity for confronting challenges and providing solutions, Lena Munuve brings all of these attributes to her role as Vivo Energy Kenya’s Retail Manager.</p>
                                <h3>What was appealing in the transition from Shell to Vivo Energy</h3>
                                <p>On first hearing about Vivo Energy, I thought “this sounds like a company with a great future”. This was evident from a number of factors – among them, the company’s ambitious growth plans, firm belief in (and commitment to) the growth potential of the African continent, and strong set of values. And of course, the fact that it is the business behind the Shell brand in Africa. I found myself gravitating naturally towards a company that had such vigour and vitality, characteristics synonymous even with the name, Vivo. Life is all about growth, and I wanted to work for a company for whom growth is its very reason for being.</p>
                                <h3>What is the best part of working at Vivo Energy?</h3>
                                <p>Seeing the company’s growth potential materialise. In the approximately 15 months that Vivo Energy Kenya has been around, I have been privileged to contribute, be a part of, and bear witness to, some extraordinary growth. During this time, we have achieved the highest network growth in the industry, delivered record sales, and rolled out a wide range of innovative and exciting promotions. It’s thrilling to be a part of a company with real life in it; a company that does things with speed, focus and in a simplified way, and for whom, simply put, it is fun to work.  </p>
                                <h3>What do you like most about your role?</h3>
                                <p>I love serving people, and I am grateful to have a job in which the ultimate goal is to keep customers happy, meet their high expectations and deliver solutions where they are required. I also delight in applying my efforts and passions to the much-loved, world-class Shell brand. I really enjoy assisting and mentoring my colleagues, particularly younger members of the team – many of whom have since grown into successful business leaders themselves. Most of all, I like to be dared. In this job, the challenges come thick and fast, and time after time, my team and I have delivered, taking great pride and enjoyment in doing so. I tell our customers – “you dare us and see what we can do!”</p>
                                <h3>How would you describe people at Vivo Energy?</h3>
                                <p>Like the company itself, Vivo Energy people are energetic. They are driven. They believe in themselves and, by extension, they believe in Vivo Energy. It almost feels like a “passion metre” was used to select them to work here. The energy that surrounds me is infectious and highly stimulating! We love our lives and our careers around here.</p>
                                <h3>What career advice would you give to someone wishing to join Vivo Energy?</h3>
                                <p>Do not hesitate to do, but only if you are willing to take the initiative, to be creative, to do things with focus and speed, to drive your own career, and most importantly, to be accountable for the space and the responsibilities given to you. Vivo Energy is a great place to work, and if your capabilities and values match those of the company, this is a place where you will thrive.</p>
