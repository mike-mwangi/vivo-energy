                                it’s the best way to succeed and grow the business. The standards we apply and adhere to
                                across Africa are the same high standards that apply in the world’s most tightly regulated
                                downstream markets. We have zero tolerance for corruption, unsafe practices, environmental
                                neglect or unfair competition.</p>

                        say ‘Vivo Energy is a great company’. When a person says ‘I work at Vivo Energy’, it must
                        resonate. In short, over time, we want to be recognised as Africa’s most respected energy business.
