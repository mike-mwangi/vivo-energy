                <p class="pera-top">Road safety is a major challenge across Africa and particularly for businesses like Vivo Energy, which rely on trucks and road tankers for supply and distribution. World Bank data indicates that 250,000 Africans are killed on the roads every year. There are too many accidents, fatalities and injuries associated with road transport in Africa and we are determined to make a difference where we can. Our programmes are designed to deliver a cultural shift in attitudes to road safety across the general population, in particular amongst school children.

Already widely recognised as an industry leader in the promotion of road safety initiatives and higher standards, we work closely with local communities to provide training, guidance, technology and, where appropriate, funding to initiate changes to road layout and signage.
