                                <p>Kennedy Bwambok <br> Management Information & Planning Analyst <br> Vivo Energy</p>
                                <p>Despite the young corporate brand, Vivo Energy is causing ripples in the industry. The aggressive growth strategies and the unending urge to excel in various jurisdictions across Africa are a perpetual reminder of what I as an individual should aspire to achieve.</p>
                                <h3>What is the best part of working at Vivo Energy?</h3>
                                <p>Despite the young corporate brand, Vivo Energy is causing ripples in the industry. The aggressive growth strategies and the unending urge to excel in various jurisdictions across Africa are a perpetual reminder of what I as an individual should aspire to achieve.</p>
                                <p>Though a licensee of Shell, one of the oldest petroleum brands, Vivo Energy never gets comfortable because of whom it is associated with and constantly challenges all of us as employees to go out there, give our best, and make it the most respected energy business in Africa, and beyond.</p>
                                <h3>What does your role entail?</h3>
                                <p>I am the country Management Information & Planning Analyst. My role encompasses financial reporting to management to enable informed decisions, and master planning to ensure all departments operate within set goals in terms of profit, margin targets and cost management (OPEX).</p>
                                <p>I also oversee several reporting tools and demand planning tools in our Supply & Operations management framework including pricing, stocks and sales analysis.</p>
                                <p>In addition, I also carry out investment and divestment reviews for new business proposals (CAPEX) and monitor key initiatives to realise desired objectives.</p>
                                <h3>What do you like most about your role?</h3>
                                <p>My role involves acting as an interface for virtually all departments in the operating unit. Therefore, I have to be aware of all activities at any given time.</p>
                                <p>I also need to understand the economy and industry in order to offer sound, realistic and achievable targets, consequently giving value to the shareholder.</p>
                                <p>Being this intermediary between the operating unit and the shareholders and the management of Vivo Energy is a great honour.</p>
                                <h3>What are your previous roles at Shell/Vivo Energy?</h3>
                                <p>While in Campus in 2010, I did my Industrial training at the then Kenya Shell Limited at the National Depot.</p>
                                <p>The role involved depot analysis in terms of accessing the effectiveness of maintenance activities, truck turnaround analysis, depot stock accounting, and ad-hoc requests for the depot manager.</p>
                                <p>The exposure was eye-opening. After three months, I went back to clear my undergraduate studies, after which I returned for a Customer Service Survey in 2011 that lasted a few weeks. I then received a scholarship to undertake my post-graduate studies.</p>
                                <h3>How would you describe people at Vivo Energy?</h3>
                                <p>A company is only as good as the people it keeps. Having begun my career at Vivo Energy, I have interacted with individuals from diverse backgrounds.</p>
                                <p>I have learned from my manager humility, respect, hard-work and integrity. Those qualities are present in each and every individual at Vivo Energy.</p>
                                <p>I am proud to be part of such a prodigious, admirable and humble family of colleagues.</p>
                                <h3>What career advice would you give to someone wishing to join Vivo Energy?</h3>
                                <p>Vivo Energy is a dynamic employer that always ventures into new ways of meeting the customers’ needs.</p>
                                <p>As a result changes to previously used systems and processes are inevitable and employees should welcome change.</p>
                                <p>Humility, respect, hard-work and integrity serve as my guiding principles.</p>
                                <p>With these traits, you are humble enough to learn, be respectful to your juniors, equals and seniors, and be efficient in your role and veracious with what has been entrusted on you by the shareholders.</p>
                                <h3>How do you make sure that you remain challenged in your role?</h3>
                                <p>In learning you will teach, and in teaching you will learn. Since I joined three years ago, I have managed to keep myself updated on industry and Vivo Energy processes.</p>
                                <p>Change is constant at Vivo Energy due to the introduction of new and effective ways to run the business.</p>
                                <p>With this, comes the need for fast learners to ensure such processes are fully implemented. I am proud to count myself as a fast learner always called upon to assist my colleagues.</p>
                                <p>Thus, I have set high expectations of what is required and this keeps me challenged.</p>
                                <h3>Vivo Energy’s vision is to create Africa’s most respected energy business. What does this mean to you personally?</h3>
                                <p>Personally, this vision implies the need to seek to grow beyond expectation as well as to empower people around me to understand and share similar aspirations.</p>
                                <p>I will of course strive to achieve my targets while respecting our core values: honesty, integrity and respect for people.</p>
