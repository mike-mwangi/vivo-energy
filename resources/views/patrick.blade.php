                                <p>The best part of working here is the people I get to interact with. They are level-headed people who share profound ideas in our daily work.</p>
                                <h3>What does your role entail?</h3>
                                <p>As Projects Engineer for Retail, I primarily manage the construction of service stations. I provide technical solutions for major repair projects at the stations and occasionally for depots and projects like tank installations, fuel pipelines replacements, canopy installations and repairs etc. I also provide technical support to new Dealer-Owned sites.</p>
                                <p>Helping build the functional competency and capacity of our contractors through contracts and contractor management processes is also part of my mission.</p>
                                <h3>What do you like most about your role?</h3>
                                <p>I admire the sincere appreciation I get from not only my superiors, but also from the people I work with. A heartfelt “thank you” affects and improve my attitude and productivity.</p>
                                <p>I like the fact that my role is not too rigid. Schedule adjustments are never a big issue as it helps in the ever increasing dynamic nature of the job.</p>
                                <p>My role also requires problem solving skills which is ideal for me since I always enjoy puzzles and love finding new solutions.</p>
                                <h3>How would you describe Vivo Energy?</h3>
                                <p>Vivo Energy is workplace where performance is recognised, appreciated and rewarded. A place where everybody feels positive about contributing to the business at the highest level. A place of belonging where people are the heart of the business.</p>
                                <h3>What career advice would you give to someone wishing to join Vivo Energy?</h3>
                                <p>This company is all about delivering performance and personally I call the tool to wheel you there the 3D’s (Discipline, Determination and Diligence) and the 3R’s (Respect for yourself, Respect for others and Responsibility taken for all actions).</p>
                                <p>Having the right attitude and working assiduously to keep your resolve will make you count.</p>

                                <p>My biggest achievement has been being part of an Health, Safety, Security and Environment change process. Thus helping change the mind set and attitude of contractors towards HSSE. Being able to contribute to my colleagues’ personal development has always been my joy and seeing people act unconsciously towards the right HSSE principles on a daily basis is what I call great so far.</p>
                                <h3>How do you make sure that you remain challenged in your role?</h3>
                                <p>By keeping a positive mental attitude to ensure continuous improvement and value creation. In addition, the challenging and thrilling nature of my job keeps me fired to always give my best.</p>
                                <h3>Vivo Energy’s vision is to create Africa’s most respected energy business. What does this mean to you personally?</h3>
